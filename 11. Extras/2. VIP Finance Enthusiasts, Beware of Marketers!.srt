1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,020
So I've said this elsewhere in the course, but I want to make it clear, for those of you who are really

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,930
interested in finance, beware of marketers in order to help you be more cognizant of those who might

3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,920
be trying to trick you.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,490
I'm going to make you an offer.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,440
Anyone, even students who are not taking this course can message me at any time and ask me, am I taking

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,480
a finance course taught by a marketer?

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,330
Of course, I can only speak to the courses where I've seen the content myself, but the few that I

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,520
have seen are ridiculously bad.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,240
Bad enough that it prompted me to make this lecture to warn you.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,880
Now, I won't tell you which course it is or which instructor it is, but I will give you a yes or no

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,580
answer telling you whether or not you are taking such a course.

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,290
Typically, these courses claim to teach you things like predicting stock prices with storms and they

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,350
will show you results like this with nearly perfect stock price predictions.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,840
Of course, those who are competent in finance know that this is nonsense.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,750
I'll also include details about what mistakes to look for in these courses so you can verify for yourself

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,890
why what they are teaching is dubious.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,980
I've heard that they are still making these mistakes and other possibly worse mistakes to this day.

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,460
In other words, thousands and thousands of students have been learning wrong and incorrect material

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,340
for years.

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,490
Believe me, if you ever try to use something like this as part of your portfolio, when you're trying

21
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,190
to get a job, nobody will take you seriously.

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,320
So that's my offer to you.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,840
If you would like to know whether or not one of the courses you are taking is taught by a known a fake

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,230
data scientist, just send me a message.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,870
You can do that either on this platform or you can go to my Web site at lezzy program or me either way

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,480
is fine.

27
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,990
Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next lecture.
